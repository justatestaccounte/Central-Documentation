## Welcome to Central Documentation

We are backended through a Github repository. In order to edit files, click the Github icon to login.

The app reaches to Github and retrieves all Markdown files associated with documentation.
The Github directory is exactly what you see in the tree navigation of this app. 
When you view any file, you are simply viewing the Github Markdown file, rendered on your device.

When you edit and choose to contribute your changes, you will automatically push and commit the file
with your changes to Central Documentation's repository. Your changes will be propagated automatically
across the entire repository, and then, to everyone who uses the app for their documentation.

### Welcome to the home for peer-edited and accessible documentation.

(This app is completely open source! Feel free to contribute to its codebase as well!)
